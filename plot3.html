    <p>
      Then college started. Life became louder, faster, more demanding—but you
      didn’t want to let go of Sky. It had become a place of comfort, a soft
      escape you clung to between assignments and lectures. So you kept logging in,
      sometimes late at night, just to glide through the skies and feel the peace
      the game always brought you. But slowly, things began to change. your
      friends—the ones you used to fly with—stopped showing up. Their candles no
      longer lit up the home space. Days passed, then weeks, and you found yourself
      wandering the realms alone. The world was still beautiful, still serene, but
      lonelier now. you stayed, hoping they’d return. you still played, but the
      silence felt heavier than before.
