      The game gently guided you with glowing symbols and visual
      cues, teaching you how to fly, light candles, and unlock new paths. The
      tutorials were subtle but helpful, easing you into the rhythm of exploration.
      you wandered through lush meadows, golden deserts, and mysterious, fog-covered
      forests, each realm more breathtaking than the last. Along the way, you
      collected shimmering winged lights and glowing emotes, slowly building your
      strength and style. But the real magic was in the people you met—silent
      figures who offered candles, gestures of friendship, and companionship in a
      world where words weren’t needed. you guys flew together, helped each other
      through challenges, and shared quiet moments beneath glowing skies. Sky
      wasn’t just a game—it felt like a peaceful escape, a gentle world that
      welcomed you with open arms.
