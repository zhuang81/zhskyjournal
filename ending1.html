    <p>
      There were no instructions, no arrows pointing the way, no voice guiding you
      through the first steps. You wandered aimlessly across vast, glowing
      landscapes, unsure of what to do or where to go. The world was beautiful,
      yes, but the silence was unsettling. You kept running, gliding, lighting
      candles—but for what purpose? With no clear goal, no sense of direction, the
      magic began to fade. Frustration crept in, and before long, curiosity gave
      way to boredom. You closed the game, uninstalled it, and left that strange,
      silent world behind, wondering what others saw in it that You just couldn’t.
