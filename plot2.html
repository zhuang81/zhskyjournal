    <p>
      Assignments piled up, your schedule filled with classes and deadlines, and your
      focus shifted. Days went by in a blur of lectures and late-night studying. you
      still thought about Sky, sometimes even launched the app just to hear the
      peaceful music—but each time, you stayed for less and less. Slowly, the game
      became a fading part of your routine, like a dream you kept meaning to return
      to, but never quite did.
